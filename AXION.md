1. Review the initialization pattern, if **`initializer`** is used in the parent contract instead of **`onlyInitializing`** the transaction will always revert.
2. Check overflow when price is calulated, if the amount is to high can be can provocate it.
3. Ensure that **`__ReentrancyGuard_init`** is called in upgradeable contracts; otherwise, **`_status`** will remain at its default value of 0 instead of 1 (**`NOT_ENTERED`**), rendering the reentrancy protection ineffective.
4. If a token is meant to be burned after withdrawing liquidity, an attacker could potentially exploit the system by sending LP tokens directly to the pool. This would allow them to attempt to burn more tokens than the pool actually holds, as the LP tokens represent liquidity but do not transfer the underlying tokens themselves.
